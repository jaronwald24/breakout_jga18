### Running the Program

 * Main class:
   * The class is run in Main.java. 
 * Data files needed:
   * The data files needed are the levels located in the src/main/resources folder.
 * Key/Mouse inputs:
   * Besides the cheat keys, one can use the keyboard's arrows to control the ball (moving left or right)
   * It's included in the directions as well, but you press enter to start and restart a game
 * Cheat keys:
   * Additional cheat keys I created include:
     * Users can press I to double the current ball size, and O, to then reset it back to normal
     * When a user presses S, the score increases by 3
     * When a user presses N, it advances to the next level, or they win, if it's the last level



### Notes/Assumptions

 * Assumptions or Simplifications:

 * Known Bugs:

 * Features implemented:
   * I implemented all the core features asked for, replacing some of the core variations with custom ones:
   * For custom features, I added:
     * Custom powerup to double the size of a ball
     * Custom brick variation to make an unbreakable brick
     * Custom paddle variation that allows for the paddle to go further into the boundaries depending on the level you are on

 * Features unimplemented:
   * None necessary
 * Noteworthy Features:
   * The powerups are a special Rectangle that fall from the brick. To collect the powerup, you need to interact with it with your paddle, otherwise it will disappear. 



### Assignment Impressions

* I think this is a really fun project, but I would've appreciated some more time with it. With noo knowledge of JavaFX and just getting acclimated to school/new classes, it was pretty difficult to find the time to put in nearly 20 hours.
